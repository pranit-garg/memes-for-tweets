## Twitter/X Thread (Launch Announcement)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I built a tool that finds the perfect meme for your tweet in 10 seconds.

No more scrolling through templates trying to find one that fits.

Here's how it works:

🧵
```

### Tweet 2
```
The problem:

You write a tweet. You want to add a meme.

But you spend 10 minutes browsing templates, none of them quite fit.

So you either:
- Post without the meme
- Settle for something mid
- Give up entirely
```

### Tweet 3
```
The fix:

Paste your tweet → get matched to meme templates that actually fit what you're saying.

Not keyword matching. It understands the joke.
```

### Tweet 4
```
How it works:

1. Paste your tweet (or idea)
2. Get 3 templates that match the vibe
3. Edit the text
4. Download and post

Takes about 10 seconds.
```

### Tweet 5
```
The best part:

You can try it free (10 matches).

If you like it, unlimited is $5/mo.

No account needed. No signup friction.

Just paste and match.
```

### Tweet 6 (CTA)
```
Try it here: memes-for-tweets.vercel.app

If you find a perfect meme for your tweet, post it and tag me.

I want to see what you create.

## Single Tweets (Standalone)

### Tweet A (Problem-focused)
```
Unpopular opinion:

The reason your tweets don't have memes isn't laziness.

It's that finding the right template takes too long.

Built a tool that fixes this → memes-for-tweets.vercel.app
```

### Tweet B (Speed-focused)
```
Perfect meme for your tweet.

10 seconds.

No scrolling through templates.

It matches the meaning, not keywords.

### Tweet C (Curiosity-driven)
```
What if you could paste your tweet and instantly get meme templates that match?

That's what I built.

Paste. Match. Download.

### Tweet D (Social proof hook)
```
Just shipped: Memes for Tweets

Paste your tweet → get matched to the perfect meme template.

Free to try. 10 seconds per meme.

Let me know if you find a good one 👇

```

### Tweet E (Hot take)
```
Hot take: Most meme generators are backwards.

They make YOU browse hundreds of templates.

Yours should find templates that match what you're trying to say.

That's what Memes for Tweets does.

I'll show you what meme it matches to.

## LinkedIn Post (Professional angle)

```
I built a tool that solves a surprisingly common problem.

You write a post. You want to add a meme. But finding the right template takes forever.

So you either skip it or settle for something that doesn't quite fit.

The fix: Paste your text, get matched to meme templates that actually fit what you're saying.

Not keyword matching. It understands the context.

Paste → Match → Edit → Download.

10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.
